		<ayam index="2" text="Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving;"/>
		<ayam index="3" text="Who has created the seven heavens one above another, you can see no fault in the creations of the Most Beneficent. Then look again: &quot;Can you see any rifts?&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="4" text="Then look again and yet again, your sight will return to you in a state of humiliation and worn out."/>
		<ayam index="5" text="And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the Shayatin (devils), and have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire."/>
		<ayam index="6" text="And for those who disbelieve in their Lord (Allah) is the torment of Hell, and worst indeed is that destination."/>
		<ayam index="7" text="When they are cast therein, they will hear the (terrible) drawing in of its breath as it blazes forth."/>
		<ayam index="8" text="It almost bursts up with fury. Every time a group is cast therein, its keeper will ask: &quot;Did no warner come to you?&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="9" text="They will say: &quot;Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we belied him and said: 'Allah never sent down anything (of revelation), you are only in great error.'&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="10" text="And they will say: &quot;Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="11" text="Then they will confess their sin. So, away with the dwellers of the blazing Fire."/>
		<ayam index="12" text="Verily! Those who fear their Lord unseen (i.e. they do not see Him, nor His Punishment in the Hereafter, etc.), theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise)."/>
		<ayam index="13" text="And whether you keep your talk secret or disclose it, verily, He is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts (of men)."/>
		<ayam index="14" text="Should not He Who has created know? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves) All-Aware (of everything)."/>
		<ayam index="15" text="He it is, Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it, etc.), so walk in the path thereof and eat of His provision, and to Him will be the Resurrection."/>
		<ayam index="16" text="Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not cause the earth to sink with you, then behold it shakes (as in an earthquake)?"/>
		<ayam index="17" text="Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allah), will not send against you a violent whirlwind? Then you shall know how (terrible) has been My Warning?"/>
		<ayam index="18" text="And indeed those before them belied (the Messengers of Allah), then how terrible was My denial (punishment)?"/>
		<ayam index="19" text="Do they not see the birds above them, spreading out their wings and folding them in? None upholds them except the Most Beneficent (Allah). Verily, He is the All-Seer of everything."/>
		<ayam index="20" text="Who is he besides the Most Beneficent that can be an army to you to help you? The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion."/>
		<ayam index="21" text="Who is he that can provide for you if He should withhold His provision? Nay, but they continue to be in pride, and (they) flee (from the truth)."/>
		<ayam index="22" text="Is he who walks without seeing on his face, more rightly guided, or he who (sees and) walks on a Straight Way (i.e. Islamic Monotheism)."/>
		<ayam index="23" text="Say it is He Who has created you, and endowed you with hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and hearts. Little thanks you give."/>
		<ayam index="24" text="Say: &quot;It is He Who has created you from the earth, and to Him shall you be gathered (in the Hereafter).&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="25" text="They say: &quot;When will this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) come to pass? if you are telling the truth.&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="26" text="Say (O Muhammad SAW): &quot;The knowledge (of its exact time) is with Allah only, and I am only a plain warner.&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="27" text="But when they will see it (the torment on the Day of Resurrection) approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will be different (black, sad, and in grieve), and it will be said (to them): &quot;This is (the promise) which you were calling for!&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="28" text="Say (O Muhammad SAW): &quot;Tell me! If Allah destroys me, and those with me, or He bestows His Mercy on us, - who can save the disbelievers from a painful torment?&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="29" text="Say: &quot;He is the Most Beneficent (Allah), in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust. So you will come to know who is it that is in manifest error.&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="30" text="Say (O Muhammad SAW): &quot;Tell me! If (all) your water were to be sunk away, who then can supply you with flowing (spring) water?&quot;"/>

		<aya index="2" text="The revelation of the Book (this Quran) is from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists) in which there is not doubt!"/>
		<aya index="3" text="Or say they: &quot;He (Muhammad SAW) has fabricated it?&quot; Nay, it is the truth from your Lord, that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you (O Muhammad SAW), in order that they may be guided."/>
		<aya index="4" text="Allah it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He Istawa (rose over) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Wali (protector or helper etc.) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or be admonished)?"/>
		<aya index="5" text="He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth, then it (affair) will go up to Him, in one Day, the space whereof is a thousand years of your reckoning (i.e. reckoning of our present world's time)."/>

		<aya index="9" text="Then He fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him the soul (created by Allah for that person), and He gave you hearing (ears), sight (eyes) and hearts. Little is the thanks you give!"/>
		<aya index="10" text="And they say: &quot;When we are (dead and become) lost in the earth, shall we indeed be recreated anew?&quot; Nay, but they deny the Meeting with their Lord!"/>
		<aya index="11" text="Say: &quot;The angel of death, who is set over you, will take your souls, then you shall be brought to your Lord.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="12" text="And if you only could see when the Mujrimun (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, etc.) shall hang their heads before their Lord (saying): &quot;Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back (to the world), we will do righteous good deeds. Verily! We now believe with certainty.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="And if We had willed, surely! We would have given every person his guidance, but the Word from Me took effect (about evil-doers), that I will fill Hell with jinn and mankind together."/>
		<aya index="14" text="Then taste you (the torment of the Fire) because of your forgetting the Meeting of this Day of yours, (and) surely! We too will forget you, so taste you the abiding torment for what you used to do."/>
		<aya index="15" text="Only those believe in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), who, when they are reminded of them fall down prostrate, and glorify the Praises of their Lord, and they are not proud."/>

		<aya index="19" text="As for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, for them are Gardens (Paradise) as an entertainment, for what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="20" text="And as for those who are Fasiqun (disbelievers and disobedient to Allah), their abode will be the Fire, every time they wish to get away therefrom, they will be put back thereto, and it will be said to them: &quot;Taste you the torment of the Fire which you used to deny.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="21" text="And verily, We will make them taste of the near torment (i.e. the torment in the life of this world, i.e. disasters, calamities, etc.) prior to the supreme torment (in the Hereafter), in order that they may (repent and) return (i.e. accept Islam)."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then he turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimun (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, etc.)."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And indeed We gave Musa (Moses) the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah)]. So be not you in doubt of meeting him [i.e. when you met Musa (Moses) during the night of Al-Isra' and Al-Mi'raj over the heavens]. And We made it [the Taurat (Torah)] a guide to the Children of Israel."/>
		<aya index="24" text="And We made from among them (Children of Israel), leaders, giving guidance under Our Command, when they were patient and used to believe with certainty in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)."/>

		<aya index="26" text="Is it not a guidance for them, how many generations We have destroyed before them in whose dwellings they do walk about? Verily, therein indeed are signs. Would they not then listen?"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Have they not seen how We drive water (rain clouds) to the dry land without any vegetation, and therewith bring forth crops providing food for their cattle and themselves? Will they not then see?"/>
		<aya index="28" text="They say: &quot;When will this Al-Fath (Decision) be (between us and you, i.e. the Day of Resurrection), if you are telling the truth?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="Say: &quot;On the Day of Al-Fath (Decision), no profit will it be to those who disbelieve if they (then) believe! Nor will they be granted a respite.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="So turn aside from them (O Muhammad SAW) and await, verily they (too) are awaiting."/>
