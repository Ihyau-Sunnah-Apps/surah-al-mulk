		<ayam index="1" text="Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent -"/>
		<ayam index="1" text="Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent -"/>
		<ayam index="2" text="[He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving -"/>
		<ayam index="3" text="[And] who created seven heavens in layers. You do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return [your] vision [to the sky]; do you see any breaks?"/>
		<ayam index="4" text="Then return [your] vision twice again. [Your] vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued."/>
		<ayam index="5" text="And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars and have made [from] them what is thrown at the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze."/>
		<ayam index="6" text="And for those who disbelieved in their Lord is the punishment of Hell, and wretched is the destination."/>
		<ayam index="7" text="When they are thrown into it, they hear from it a [dreadful] inhaling while it boils up."/>
		<ayam index="8" text="It almost bursts with rage. Every time a company is thrown into it, its keepers ask them, &quot;Did there not come to you a warner?&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="9" text="They will say,&quot; Yes, a warner had come to us, but we denied and said, 'Allah has not sent down anything. You are not but in great error.'&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="10" text="And they will say, &quot;If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze.&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="11" text="And they will admit their sin, so [it is] alienation for the companions of the Blaze."/>
		<ayam index="12" text="Indeed, those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward."/>
		<ayam index="13" text="And conceal your speech or publicize it; indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts."/>
		<ayam index="14" text="Does He who created not know, while He is the Subtle, the Acquainted?"/>
		<ayam index="15" text="It is He who made the earth tame for you - so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision - and to Him is the resurrection."/>
		<ayam index="16" text="Do you feel secure that He who [holds authority] in the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would sway?"/>
		<ayam index="17" text="Or do you feel secure that He who [holds authority] in the heaven would not send against you a storm of stones? Then you would know how [severe] was My warning."/>
		<ayam index="18" text="And already had those before them denied, and how [terrible] was My reproach."/>
		<ayam index="19" text="Do they not see the birds above them with wings outspread and [sometimes] folded in? None holds them [aloft] except the Most Merciful. Indeed He is, of all things, Seeing."/>
		<ayam index="20" text="Or who is it that could be an army for you to aid you other than the Most Merciful? The disbelievers are not but in delusion."/>
		<ayam index="21" text="Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision? But they have persisted in insolence and aversion."/>
		<ayam index="22" text="Then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one who walks erect on a straight path?"/>
		<ayam index="23" text="Say, &quot;It is He who has produced you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful.&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="24" text="Say, &quot;It is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="25" text="And they say, &quot;When is this promise, if you should be truthful?&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="26" text="Say, &quot;The knowledge is only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner.&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="27" text="But when they see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will be distressed, and it will be said, &quot;This is that for which you used to call.&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="28" text="Say, [O Muhammad], &quot;Have you considered: whether Allah should cause my death and those with me or have mercy upon us, who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment?&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="29" text="Say, &quot;He is the Most Merciful; we have believed in Him, and upon Him we have relied. And you will [come to] know who it is that is in clear error.&quot;"/>
		<ayam index="30" text="Say, &quot;Have you considered: if your water was to become sunken [into the earth], then who could bring you flowing water?&quot;"/>

	<aya index="1" text="Alif, Lam, Meem."/>
		<aya index="1" text="Alif, Lam, Meem."/>
		<aya index="2" text="[This is] the revelation of the Book about which there is no doubt from the Lord of the worlds."/>
		<aya index="3" text="Or do they say, &quot;He invented it&quot;? Rather, it is the truth from your Lord, [O Muhammad], that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you [so] perhaps they will be guided."/>
		<aya index="4" text="It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days; then He established Himself above the Throne. You have not besides Him any protector or any intercessor; so will you not be reminded?"/>
		<aya index="5" text="He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; then it will ascend to Him in a Day, the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count."/>
		<aya index="6" text="That is the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,"/>
		<aya index="7" text="Who perfected everything which He created and began the creation of man from clay."/>
		<aya index="8" text="Then He made his posterity out of the extract of a liquid disdained."/>
		<aya index="9" text="Then He proportioned him and breathed into him from His [created] soul and made for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful."/>
		<aya index="10" text="And they say, &quot;When we are lost within the earth, will we indeed be [recreated] in a new creation?&quot; Rather, they are, in [the matter of] the meeting with their Lord, disbelievers."/>
		<aya index="11" text="Say, &quot;The angel of death will take you who has been entrusted with you. Then to your Lord you will be returned.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="12" text="If you could but see when the criminals are hanging their heads before their Lord, [saying], &quot;Our Lord, we have seen and heard, so return us [to the world]; we will work righteousness. Indeed, we are [now] certain.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="13" text="And if We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect [that] &quot;I will surely fill Hell with jinn and people all together."/>
		<aya index="14" text="So taste [punishment] because you forgot the meeting of this, your Day; indeed, We have [accordingly] forgotten you. And taste the punishment of eternity for what you used to do.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="15" text="Only those believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded by them, fall down in prostration and exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord, and they are not arrogant."/>
		<aya index="16" text="They arise from [their] beds; they supplicate their Lord in fear and aspiration, and from what We have provided them, they spend."/>
		<aya index="17" text="And no soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort for eyes as reward for what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="18" text="Then is one who was a believer like one who was defiantly disobedient? They are not equal."/>
		<aya index="19" text="As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, for them will be the Gardens of Refuge as accommodation for what they used to do."/>
		<aya index="20" text="But as for those who defiantly disobeyed, their refuge is the Fire. Every time they wish to emerge from it, they will be returned to it while it is said to them, &quot;Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="21" text="And we will surely let them taste the nearer punishment short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will repent."/>
		<aya index="22" text="And who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord; then he turns away from them? Indeed We, from the criminals, will take retribution."/>
		<aya index="23" text="And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so do not be in doubt over his meeting. And we made the Torah guidance for the Children of Israel."/>
		<aya index="24" text="And We made from among them leaders guiding by Our command when they were patient and [when] they were certain of Our signs."/>
		<aya index="25" text="Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ."/>
		<aya index="26" text="Has it not become clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them, [as] they walk among their dwellings? Indeed in that are signs; then do they not hear?"/>
		<aya index="27" text="Have they not seen that We drive the water [in clouds] to barren land and bring forth thereby crops from which their livestock eat and [they] themselves? Then do they not see?"/>
		<aya index="28" text="And they say, &quot;When will be this conquest, if you should be truthful?&quot;"/>
		<aya index="29" text="Say, [O Muhammad], &quot;On the Day of Conquest the belief of those who had disbelieved will not benefit them, nor will they be reprieved.&quot;"/>
		<aya index="30" text="So turn away from them and wait. Indeed, they are waiting."/>
